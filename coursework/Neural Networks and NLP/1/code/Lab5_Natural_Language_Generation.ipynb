    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is one of the key areas of Natural Language Processing with a range of applications such as dialogue generation, question-answering, machine translation, summarisation, etc. Current state-of-the-art in language generation predominantly uses pre-trained Transformer-based language models. In addition to the Transformer design and unsupervised training, more efficient decoding techniques are also very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modelling concerns predicting the next word given the words generated so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y_t | y_1, \\ldots ,y_{t-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the probability of the sequence of words we use the chain rule of probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y_1, y_2, \\ldots ,y_n) = \\prod_{t=1}^{n} P(y_t | y_1, \\ldots ,y_{t-1})$\n",

    "**What is the difference between word embeddings and language modelling?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The main difference that word embeddings do not take word order into account. Language models take word order into account. The word order is very important. If you do not take the word order into account the representation of the following sentences will be the same: \"It was really not good, on the opposite quite bad.\" and \"It was really not bad, on the opposite quite good.\" However, the meaning of those two sentences is very different.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is the output of the network is computed ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the output layer outputs a vector with the same dimensionality as the vocabulary size of our language model. Those values are inputted into the softmax function that normalises them and outputs a probability distribution over our vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = g(z_i) =  \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum^k_{j=1}e^{z_j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a vocabulary of three words and the output vector $\\mathsf{z}= [2.0, \\; 1.0, \\; 0.1]$. The result of the application of softmax will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = [\\frac{e^{2.0}}{e^{2.0} + e^{1.0} + e^{0.1}}, \\; \\frac{e^{1.0}}{e^{2.0} + e^{1.0} + e^{0.1}}, \\; \\frac{e^{0.1}}{e^{2.0} + e^{1.0} + e^{0.1}}] = [0.66,\\; 0.24, \\; 0.1]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the training loss for LM tasks ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are typically trained to minimise cross-entropy. The entropy of a distribution P measures how many bits you need on average to encode data from P with the code that is optimal for P:\n",
    "\n",
    " $H(P)\\ = - \\sum_ iP(y_i)\\log P(y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a number in bits, we need to take a log base 2 of N.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-entropy of a distribution P with respect to a distribution Q measures how many bits you need on average to encode data from P with the code that is optimal for Q:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H(P,Q)\\ = \\ - \\sum_ iP(y_i)\\log Q(y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful to measure how well the predicted distribution Q models P.\n",
    "\n",
    "For prediction problems, like predicting words in language modeling, we often have just probability of 1 for the true word (for the rest of the words it is 0, remember the one-hot encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we usually minimise the negative log likehood (NLL) of correct words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ NLL = -\\sum_n\\log Q(y_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ is the correct word (word from the reference sentence created by the human). This is equavalent to maximising the probability of correct words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are language models trained ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Very often the so-called \"teacher forcing\" is used. It works by using the actual ground true word from the training dataset at the current time step t as input to the next time step t+1, rather than the output generated by the network. This makes learning faster and the model more stable. The model is not going to get punished for every subsequent word it generates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly install transformers and load the model. We will use GPT2 in Tensorflow 2.1 as an example of a Large Language Model (LLM)."
